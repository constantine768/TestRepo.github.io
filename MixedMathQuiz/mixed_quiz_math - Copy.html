  {
    question: "Ram had 12 chocolates. If he gave 7 chocolates to his sister, then what fraction of the chocolates did his sister get?",
    options: ["6/12", "7/12", "5/12", "2/12"],
    correctAnswer: "7/12",
    explanation: "total number of chocolates = 12 = the denominator\nnumber of chocolates Raj gave to his sister = 7 = the numerator\n∴ the required fraction = 7/12\nHence, the correct answer is Option (b) that is 7/12."

  {
    question: "In the given figure, name any one radius of the circle having S as the centre.",
    options: ["PS", "QS", "RS", "All of the above"],
    correctAnswer: "PS",
    explanation: "In the given figure, S is the centre of the circle. P, Q and R are the points on the circle. Thus, PS, QS and RS are the radii of the circle."
  },
  {
    question: "Fill in the blank. 9867 − ___ = 9866",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation: "When we subtract 1 from a number, we get the predecessor of the given number as the difference. The predecessor of 9867 is 9866. Hence, 9866 is the difference obtained when 1 is subtracted from 9867."
  },
  {
    question: "The numerator of a fraction is 3 and its denominator is 2 more than the numerator. The fraction is _____.",
    options: ["3/4", "3/5", "3/6", "3/7"],
    correctAnswer: "3/5",
    explanation: "numerator of the fraction = 3\nAs its denominator is 3 more than the numerator, the denominator is 3 + 2 = 5.\n∴ the fraction = 3/5\nHence, the required fraction is 3/5."
  },
  {
    question: "9209 − ______ = 3542",
    options: ["5667", "5668", "5669", "5670"],
    correctAnswer: "5667",
    explanation: "9209 – 5667 = 3542"
  },
  {
    question: "Wholes that are divided unequally represent fractions.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correctAnswer: "False",
    explanation: "Wholes that are not divided equally do not represent fractions. A fraction represents an equal part of the whole.  Hence, the given statement is false."
  },
  {
    question: "800 mm = 80 cm",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correctAnswer: "True",
    explanation: "800 mm = (800 ÷ 10) cm\n= 80 cm\nHence, the given statement is true."

  {
    question: "Raj measured the length of a stick in metres. If he wants to write the length in centimetres, then he needs to divide the length by 100.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correctAnswer: "False",
    explanation: "To convert metres into centimetres, we need to multiply it by 100.\nFor example: 7 m = 7 × 100 cm = 700 cm"
